Hey! I’m just someone who enjoys messing around with tech, especially when it comes to hacking and figuring out how things work. I spend a lot of time on platforms like HTB, solving boxes for fun and learning along the way. I’m into CTFs, Cybersecurity events, and occasionally digging way too deep into random side projects. Outside of the tech world, I’m usually working out, chilling with friends, or watching something completely unrelated. Always down to learn new stuff, chat about hacks, or team up for challenges. Just here to have fun and keep leveling up. Don't hesitate to send me a DM on discord to hack together!
